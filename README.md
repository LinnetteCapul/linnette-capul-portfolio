Linnette Capul, web developer in training

## Description

Hello! My name is Linnette and I have recently discovered the world of possibilities in web development. I first realized my interest in web development in 2021 when I was supporting a website project for a non-profit I had worked with. From there, I wanted to learn the ins and outs of web development. It such an immersive world of possibilities and creativity. It's almost like magic in some cases, and I want to be a part of the magic! Currently, I am a student in UCLA Extension - Full Stack Web Development program where I will learn to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and much more.

Project: Improved an online marketing agency's website to update their accesibility standards in order to optimize it for search engines and an easier user experience for people with disabilities. This was done through code refactor for their HTML and CSS code.
