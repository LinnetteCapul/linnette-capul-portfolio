# Linnette Irene Capul: Web Developer

## ✨Adding some magic on the web ✨

## Description

Hello! My name is Linnette and I have recently discovered the world of possibilities in web development. I first realized my interest in web development in 2021 while I was supporting a website project for a non-profit I had worked with. From there, I wanted to really learn the ins and outs of web development. It so immersive that the creativity and capabilities are endless. It's almost like magic in some cases, and I want to bring that magic into reality. Currently, I am a student in UCLA Extension - Full Stack Web Development program where I will learn to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and much more.
